Description of tools

These programs may need the following config files:
- walls.txt: a list of walls' coordinates x,y (one per line)
- victims.txt: a list of victims' coordinates x,y (one per line)
- sinais_vitais.txt: the vital signals of the victims (one line per victim)

compare_predict_target_1to1.py: compares the reference results of classification and regression for the class of gravity and value of gravity with predicted values. It prints classification metrics, regression metrics, and specific problem metrics. The reference file and predict file must be the same size.    

compare_predict_target_withMatch.py: compares the reference results of classification and regression for the class of gravity and value of gravity with predicted values matching the victims by <id, x, y>. It prints classification metrics, regression metrics, and specific problem metrics only for the matched victims. The predicted file may be of equal or less size than the reference file.

edit_draw_2d_grid.py: read the walls.txt file and victims.txt file and allows the user to add/remove walls and add/remove victims.

generate_walls_and_victims.py: Generate walls from a input file with the following format per line: col_ini,row_ini,col_end,row_end. Besides, if you define N_VICTIMS > 0, the program generates N_VICTIMS
situated in random positions (except at any coordinate where there is a already wall). It creates two output files: walls.txt and victims.txt

plot_2d_grid.py: Read the walls.txt and the victims.txt and plots the 2D grid. The origin of the 2D grid is at the top left corner. Indexation is x,y = col, row

rewrite_victim_id.py: read the sinais_vitais.txt and renumber the first column from 1 to n (the id of victims). When you copy one or more lines of sinais_vitais.txt, renumbering the victims sequential number is necessary.
